// The guard name stays PLANE_RADAR_DEBUG even though this is no longer the
// plane radar: platformio.ini's -D and this #if have to agree, and a rename
// touching only one of them compiles every DEBUG_LOG out while still looking
// enabled -- which shows up as a heap measurement that prints nothing.

/**
 * Opt-in verbose logging, compiled out entirely by default.
 *
 * Enable with `-DPLANE_RADAR_DEBUG=1` (see the `supermini-debug` env in
 * platformio.ini). When it is off, every call below expands to a `do {} while
 * (0)`: no code, no branch, and -- the part that matters on this chip -- none
 * of the format strings are emitted into flash. Arguments are NOT evaluated.
 *
 * Rules for call sites:
 *  - Never put a side effect in a DEBUG_LOG argument. It will not run in a
 *    release build.
 *  - A local computed only for a log message needs [[maybe_unused]]: the
 *    release build eliminates it, and this project can build with -Wall.
 *  - Anything expensive to COMPUTE for the message must be guarded with
 *    DEBUG_LOG_ENABLED, not just wrapped in DEBUG_LOG.
 *  - Never call it from the per-aircraft draw loop, the per-segment runway
 *    loop, or the fetch task's inner loop. `Serial` here is USB CDC (HWCDC),
 *    not a UART, so the cost is not baud rate: `HWCDC::write` BLOCKS on the TX
 *    ring for up to 100 ms when no host is draining it -- a full render tick,
 *    on a ~35 ms frame. A detached device with logging on must not stall.
 *  - In the draw path and the fetch task, keep each RENDERED line under 64
 *    characters: Print::printf formats into a 64-byte stack buffer and mallocs
 *    past it, and CLAUDE.md's rule is no heap in the draw path. Boot-time lines
 *    may be longer -- they run once, before any of that matters.
 *  - In the fetch task, remember the vsnprintf frame comes out of its ~3.6 KB
 *    of stack headroom -- the number fetchTaskStackFree() exists to watch.
